And, a data structure, LinkedList, is utilized to keep track of document IDs in which a term occurs.

Each document is represented by <DOC> element, which has a document ID, headline, and text content. Looping through the file to find all <DOC> element under the root of the XML file; the document ID, headlines, and text are extracted and nomalized (removing punctuation and lowercasing). Stopping and stemming are also considered on or off. Then, a terms_array is initilized to add unique terms. A inverted dictionary named as term_doc_dict dictionary is initialized to contain the unique terms as keys and a LinkedList of document IDs in which that terms occurs in the collection. For each unique term in the terms_array, if it already exists in term_doc_dict dictionary, the document ID is add into the LinkedList document IDs belonging to that term. If a unique term in a document ID does not appear in the term_doc_dict dictionary, a new linkedlist is generated and the document ID in which that unique term occurs is also added into the just created LinkedList document IDs.  \n"

    "In my project 2, I implemented the Boolean retrieval function, using an expression tree. In order to carry out an expression tree from a given query, a TreeNode class is defined, representing each node in a tree and storing data which could be a term or a logical expression later on. In addition, each parent tree node has pointers to its left and right children node. Based on the orignal human readable query, a postfix expression is build. Logical expressions such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" are prioritized using a ranking score system (logical_score = {\"not\": 3, \"or\": 2, \"and\": 1}) so that top nodes of building the tree are classified. In this case, \"and\" will be likely to be a parent node than \"not\" and \"or\", and \"or\" tends to be a parent node of \"not\". Looping through each token in the infix expression array, if it is a term, add it to the posfix stack, if ut is a logical operators, add it to the logic stack. When the logical operator is \"not\", it is added to the logic stack. When the logical operators are \"and\", \"or\", while the logic stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is not \"not\", if the top element of the stack has a higher or equal score than the current token, pop the top logical operator from logic stack and appends it to the postfix expression to ensure token with higher score are evaluated first. Then add the current token to the logic stack. And, while there is still logical operators in the logic stack, remove (.pop) it from the stack and add it to the postfix stack. Consequently, from the postfix stack for an expression tree is built in which parent nodes represent logical operators and chil nodes represent terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "For building an expression tree, an empty stack is initialized and logical expressions or logical operators are \"not\", \"or\", \"and\". Each token in the postfix array created above is iterated. If a current token is a term, create a term tree node and push that term into the stack. If a current token is an logical operator, pop 2 values from the stack and make the 2 values become children nodes of the logical operator node and push that current node into the stack. If the logical operator is \"not\", get the top element from the stack, create a \"not\" tree node and then assign the term as the right node of the \"not\" parent node. Otherwise, if token is either \"and\", \"or\", get the 2 top elements from the stack, create a tree node for either \"and\" or \"or\", and then assign the 2 consecutive terms as the right and left children nodes. Afterwards, add that logical operator tree node into the stack. When the first element of the stack is returned, a root node associated with a built logical expression tree is returned. \n",

Finally, the boolean retrieval function is generated to evaluate the expression tree in which the leaf nodes are terms corresponding to LinkedLists document IDs. Starting from the root, each subtree are recursively evaluated based on the operator at each parent node (and, or, not) and combine their results by calling the 3 defined boolean search functions. \n",

    "For retrieval using the similarity function above, a term frequency dictionary is generated given an XML file in order to calculate the number of times a term occurs in a document. An application of the Element Tree (ET) library is also used for parsing the XML file, looping through each document element in the tree and finding all headline, text elements and document number. The text is also normalized like removing punctuation and lowcasing; stemming and stopping are also applied for later results comparision.  Then, a terms_array is initilized to add unique terms from text and headline parts. Each term frequency is counted in each document and updated in the tf_subdict dictionary. Iterating each term key in the tf_subdict, if the term is not in the general term frequency dictionary (term_freq_dict), an empty sub-dictionary for storing document numbers and related term frequencies is created. And, the term frequency is assigned as the value of the document number key in which the term occurs in the sub-dictionary. The term in the general term frequency dictionary (term_freq_dict) is sorted in ascending order. Generally, the term frequency dictionary (term_freq_dict) has unique terms in the collection as keys and their values are sub-dictionaries in which the keys are documents containing that terms and the values are term frequencies. Secondly, a document frequency dictionary is generated using the term frequency dictionary. It calculates how many documents that the term occurs in a collection (in other words, it's the length of the sub-dictionaries of each terms). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, with df dictionary and all document IDs dictionary, a function to compute inverse document frequencies (idf) for each unique term in the collection is defined. In the loop of each term in the df dictionary, a document frequency value is retrieved and the log based 10 according to the division between a total number of documents (N) and the df is calculated. Idf is a measure of how much information the word provides whether it's common or rare across a collection of all documents. Fourthly, a compute_document_length function calculates the length of each document in terms of the number of unique terms after preprocessing. Consequently, the similarity_score function takes a query and computes its similarity score with each document using a normalized TF-IDF scores and document normalization. It considers the term frequency, document frequency, and the length of documents to provide a relevance score for each document; stemming and stopping are also considered True or False for results comparision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the queries were read from the queries.lab3.txt file. Each query is pre-processed similarly to document pre-processing (e.g. if stemming is applied in documents, it is also applied in the query, likewise stopping). And, the similarity scores between the query and the document IDs or document numbers are stored in an dictionary (tfidf_score dictionary). The document normalization considers document length to prevent bias towards longer documents. Documents are scored based on how terms in the query appear in each document, taking into account the tf.idf of terms and the length of documents. The ranked retrieval results are sorted by the similarity score in descending order for each query, which means documents are ranked from most to least relevant."

It is an simple algorithm but if it is a common word across a collection such as \"the\", more documents will be retrieved and the results might be potentially irrelevant and lack of precision. So, the downside of the approach might be not actually considering whether a term is common or rare. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean Search involves generating an data structure like an expression tree to evaluate logical expression (sentence containing logical operators such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\") to combine terms and retrieve more relevant documents. It's more precise than the word overlap approach because it retrieves documents that strictly meet the logical criteria. However, for comple queries, it is more difficult to implement an efficient and flexible boolean search and take more time to process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ranked Retrieval (tf.idf) scores the similarity between a query and documents in a collection. It's based on the frequency of query terms in each document and how common these terms are across all documents. These scores are used to rank documents in terms of its relevance to the query. This approach mainly involves calculating term frequencies, document frequencies, tf.idf scores and document normalization. Ranked Retrieval (tf.idf) also gives a weight to each unique terms through scoring and help us distinguish documents containing common terms versus those containing rare terms. That is aligned with more relevance of retrieved results."

    "d) What challenges you faced when implementing it\n",

    "One main challenge I encountered when implementing boolean search is that I was stuck with data structure approach is suitable to use for evaluating the boolean expression. I had a LinkedList document IDs of each term but I was struggling how to retrieve a LinkedList document IDs when there are more than 2 terms and boolean operators (such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\"). I asked Astrid for help and she recommended me to try to use the expression tree. Expresession tree is similar to a binary tree to some extent. I googled and watched some videos related to how to implement an expression tree. So, given a boolean expression query, \"and\" has a higher rank than \"or\" and \"not\", and \"or\" has a higher rank than \"or\". \"And\" is aimed to be the top of the expression tree. A given infix boolean expression is converted into a postfix using a stack. Then, another stack is used to generate an expression tree from this postfix expression. For each term in a query, a term tree node is created and pushed into the stack. And for each logical operator, 2 terms from the stack are poped and make them become children nodes of the logical operator node then push back that sub-tree onto the stack. The expression tree is executed from the bottom to the top in which the leaves are LinkedList document IDs of terms in the query. From all that knowledge, I proceeded to implement the Boolean search. \n",

Documents containing query terms have a score of 0 at first, then a similarity score between the query and the document is calculated and added to the documents' scores. A dictionary of documents in which query terms occur and their associated similarity scores with the query are generated. It also took me some time to figure out how to implement stemming and stopping into the code and compare results with my classmates.  "

While with both stemming and stopping the similarity score goes down, indicating that reducing words might loose some information although it helps reduce irrelevant common words such as \"the\" and retrieve more relevant documents associated with terms telling the context of the document. With only stemming, the similarity score even goes down, showing that stemming words withough removing stop words is not an efficient way and the short form of the words might not be relavant enough to capture the context of the document.  \n",
